### Credits:

The main pyramid stack algorithm was inspired by the [Laplacian pyramids method](https://github.com/sjawhar/focus-stacking) implementation by Sami Jawhar. The latest implementation was rewritten from hte original code that was used under permission of the author for initial versions of this package.
